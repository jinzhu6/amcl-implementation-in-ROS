# Robot Localization implementation in ROS

Qiwei Yang

### 1. Introduction

In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

Over the course of the project, as part of the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

Creating a ROS package that launches a custom r-obot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.

### 2. Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter estimates the value of a variable by updating its estimate as measurement data is collected filtering out the noise. Kalman Filters models the state uncertainty using Gaussians and it is capable of making accurate estimates with just a few data points.

KF starts with an initial state estimate then performs the following cycle: measurement update produced by sensor measurements followed by a state prediction from control actions.

### 3. Monte Carlo Localization method (also called Particle filters)

Particle filters
Monte Carlo localization algorithm similar to Kalman Filters estimates the posterior distribution of a robotâ€™s position and orientation based on sensory information but instead of using Gaussians it uses particles to model state.

The algorithm is similar to KF where motion and sensor updates are calculated in a loop but MCL adds one additional step: a particle resampling process where particles with large importance weights (computed during sensor updates) survive while particles with low weights are ignored.

In the MCL example below all particles are uniformly distributed initially. In the following update steps the particles that better match the predicted state survive resulting in a concentration of particles around the robot estimated location.
